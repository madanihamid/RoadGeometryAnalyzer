qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=Estimate basic road segment geometry (curve/straight) for road safety analysis.
version=0.1
author=Hamid Madani
email=hamidmadani419@gmail.com

about=This plugin estimates the geometric type (curve or straight) of road segments based on vertex positions and curvature calculations. It helps in generating basic geometric attributes for road datasets where such data is missing â€” especially useful in road safety analysis and risk assessment projects.
